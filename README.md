Tip Out was developed and maintained solely by myself, Skyy Moore, during the Covid-19 lockdowns in Los Angeles, CA.
The app was available on the Apple App Store from June 2022 to August 2023. 

Created with no formal training, this project reflects a journey of learning, dedication,
and a deep understanding of what bartenders and waiters need to calculate complicated tip out formulas at the end of long shift.

## FEATURES

- Easy to use interface, just answers the question and it modifies the formula for you.
- Will accept as many bartenders or departments for tipping out as needed.
- Generates an easy to understand report which can be screen shoted and send off to the rest of the team.

## DEVELOPEMENT

Tip Out was coded in the Xcode IDE and submitted and reviewed by the Apple Store Connect Team.
It required organizing an LLC in California, Moore Apps LLC, and acquiring a business bank account.
I used the Model-View-Controller design pattern. 
The final version of Tip Out used the SwiftUI framework, but the earlier version used the more traditional UIKit approach.

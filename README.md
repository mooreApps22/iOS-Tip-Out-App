# OVERVIEW of the Tip Out App
## This app was featured on the Apple App Store
### This app makes it easy for the closing bartender to create a Tip Out Report for the whole bar team.

**Backstory**

This is my first-ever project and Swift is the first computer language I learned. I taught myself to code during the COVID-19 lockdown. I was bartending in Los Angeles and all the bars were closed. I had a lot of free time so I decided to pick up a new skill. I fell in love with programming and decided to pursue it. Since then I've been coding non-stop.

In order to put this app on the Apple App Store I had to start a business, get a business bank account, become a Trusted Apple Developer, and go through the Apple Store Connect re-process. This app generates sales and has been used in real-world work environments. It was an invaluable experience and I learned a lot.

**Basics**

Tip Out has a minimalist, sleek aesthetic presented in Dark Mode. Tip Out is intuitive and most of the prompts are self-explanatory. I did not like the standard iOS keyboard for Tip Out, so I built a custom keyboard and number pad that only features unable characters and fits the visual theme of the app.

8. Review the Tip Out Report to know how much everyone is paid. You can review it and go back to make edits and if you want you can screenshot the report to text to everyone in the team. The Tip Out Report is scrollable so it doesn't matter how many bartenders and barbacks you include.
